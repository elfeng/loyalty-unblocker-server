## What is Loyalty Unblocker?
This is a PoC application that offers loyalty points in the form of Ether, which can then be redeemed on Expedia as well as other businesses.

## Opportunity & Goal
* As an Expedia customer, I would like to be able to use loyalty points obtained to purchase products from other businesses.
* Loyalty points are currently a liability for Expedia, moving onto the blockchain it could then become an expense.
* By increasing the utility value of loyalty points offered, potential customers will be more inclined to use Expedia as their Online Travel Agency because our loyalty program will be more competitive.

## What's next?

We plan on extending this application to support other ways to reward loyalty Ether, which could include writing quality reviews and completing surveys. We also plan on integrating other LOBs' shopping paths into the application. We see the future serving many more loyal customers.

Feel free to contact us if you any questions!
